First, let me briefly talk about that we use Cursor to build a code creation platform, and we also work with
Neoclouds, a new cloud service that specializes in renting computing power to companies that need to train
or infer AI models.
There are many benefits to working with them. One of them is that the founder used to work in hardware
and has considerable experience in both software and hardware.
Our vision isn’t just to enter the market — we want to lead it.
To gain market dominance, we’re applying a diversified strategy:
Localized versions with language and culture-specific features.
Flexible payment options like credit installments and partner financing — we're in talks with leasing
companies.
As you can see, we offer three subscription models that maximize value for every type of user.
Robots: NT$200,000, with a free two-month Pro subscription.
But we’re not stopping there.
To create herd behavior, we plan to partner with influencers, launch limited-edition campaigns, and build
early hype.
Our goal is to make CaroBot feel essential — like the iPhone of emotional care.
We will collaborate with lifestyle influencers in tech and caregiving to build aspirational value.
Create “first-to-own” social campaigns, tapping into the same psychological desire that made the iPhone a
must-have.
We want CaroBot to be seen not as a gadget — but a daily emotional companion,
a symbol of care and connection.
Just like the iPhone revolutionized communication,
CaroBot will redefine what it means to “be there” for your loved ones.
